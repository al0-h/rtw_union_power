\section{Data}
% Source: CPS MORG or Hirsch–Macpherson union database
[[explain CPS ORG data: why the selected date range]]
% CPS union questions first introduced in 1983 

% Unit of observation: individual workers (state-year panel)
[[Unit of obs]]

% Key variables:

%   Union membership indicator

%   RTW adoption dates by state

%   Covariates: age, education, race, gender, industry, occupation
[[Any issues with harmonization of data]]

% Sample restrictions (e.g., private sector only)
[[Sample restrictions]]

% Summary statistics
[[\textbf{SUM STATS TABLE RTW V NON-RTW}]]
% Im not sure how useful this would be 


\section{Empirical Results}
\subsection{Descriptive Trends (May Remove)}
% Graph: Union membership over time by RTW status
[[\textbf{Union membership over time by RTW status}]]

figure centered at before and after adoption
% Caption goes below figure. Use figurenotes if needed for sources.

\subsection{ATT Estimates from Linear Model}
% Use Callaway–Sant’Anna DiD with LPM

% Event-study style plot of ATT(g,t)
[[\textbf{Event-study style plot of ATT lin CS Did}]]

% Table of average treatment effects
[[\textbf{Table of ATT effects}]]
% Table caption goes above. Tablenotes go below.

\subsection{Binary Estimator Results[[IF done]]}
% Apply your method (logit-based marginal ATT(g,t))

% Compare trajectory of effects to LPM-based results
[[\textbf{Event-study style plot of ATT binary CS Did}]]
% Interpret change in probabilities (e.g., “2 pp decline”)

\subsection{Robustness and Heterogeneity}
% Alternative comparison groups (never-treated vs not-yet-treated)

% Subgroup analysis (e.g., manufacturing, education level)

% Sensitivity to control set

% Split into high and Low HHI areas

\section{Discussion}
% What do the results suggest about RTW and union power?
[[What do these finding show about union power]]

% IF DONE: does the new method improve interpretability or accuracy?

% IF DONE: Why this matters for applied DiD work with binary outcomes
