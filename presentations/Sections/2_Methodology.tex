\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Review of Callaway–Sant’Anna Estimator}




%   Briefly describe ATT(g,t), comparison groups, assumptions
[[Introduce CS DiD and the challenges it addresses from the TWFE ]]

* Issues with heterogeneity in the treatment which CS did solves 

I exploit the staggered timing of state Right-to-Work (RTW) adoptions in a modern difference-in-differences framework (Callaway \& Sant'Anna) to estimate cohort and time-specific average treatment effects (ATTs).
First, I estimate the RTW impact on union membership (first stage) and on outcomes. 
I then form Wald-style instrumental-variables estimates—dividing the reduced-form RTW effects by the RTW-induced change in unionization—to recover the causal effect of unions for “complier” states. 

[[Explain the Wald ratio and method to estimate the SEs]]
% Delta method for now until I can find something better seems like the standard.



%   Explain how it’s typically applied (with continuous or linear models)
[[Explain how it is applied to linear and cont models]]

\subsection{Alternative Estimation: Syn Staggared Diff-in-Diff}
[[ONLY IF: the binary outcome isnt done and I have room]]
\subsection{IF DONE: Binary Outcome Challenges and Proposed Extension}
%   Define the estimand: ATT(g,t) for binary Y in {0,1}
[[Explain the new estimator]]

%   Discuss LPM limitations: heteroskedasticity, probability bounds
[[Discuss assumptions and limitations]]

%   Describe your solution: e.g., marginal effects from logistic regression

%   Inference strategy (e.g., bootstrapped CIs)

%   How it respects staggered adoption structure
[[explain how it keeps the staggered adoption structure]]
