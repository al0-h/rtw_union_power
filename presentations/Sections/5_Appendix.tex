\section{Appendix}
% Additional regression tables

% Simulation results (if you include any)

% Derivations or estimator code notes

% Use standard \section{Appendix A: ...} format â€” not special environments.
[[Additional robustness analysis like Synthetic Controls with Staggered Adoption ]]
% Will have to do this in R since Stata doesn't support this natively.

[[Sdid estimation of the treatment effect]]
