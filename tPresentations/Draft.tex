% The mathtime package uses a Times font instead of Computer Modern.
% Uncomment the line below if you wish to use the mathtime package:
%\usepackage[cmbold]{mathtime}
% Note that miktex, by default, configures the mathtime package to use commercial fonts
% which you may not have. If you would like to use mathtime but you are seeing error
% messages about missing fonts (mtex.pfb, mtsy.pfb, or rmtmi.pfb) then please see
% the technical support document at http://www.aeaweb.org/templates/technical_support.pdf
% for instructions on fixing this problem.

% Note: you may use either harvard or natbib (but not both) to provide a wider
% variety of citation commands than latex supports natively. See below.

% Uncomment the next line to use the natbib package with bibtex 
%\usepackage{natbib}

% Uncomment the next line to use the harvard package with bibtex
%\usepackage[abbr]{harvard}

% This command determines the leading (vertical space between lines) in draft mode
% with 1.5 corresponding to "double" spacing.

% Current plan
% Paper stays around 30-40 pages no citations or appendix
% Current issues More Concrete evidence there is a oligopsony issue.
% More empirical work on this subject or evidence I can show
%   Possible solutions:
%       Estimating labor elasticities - inelasticity implies workers do not quit or join based on changes in wages
